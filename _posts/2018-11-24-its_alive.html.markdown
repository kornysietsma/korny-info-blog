I'm moving everything to Google Domains as I don't see the value in paying
for complex hosting.  I'm using github pages for hosting static sites like
this one - I'll see how it scales, it doesn't have unlimited scale but I don't
think I get that many hits!

For the moment this is using my fairly creaky middleman-blog setup - I might
look at moving to Jekyll as that's what Github does best.  And I fear the
css here is probably pretty dated, as I haven't done much CSS since 2013 and it's
now 2018...  anyway, for now I'll port everything with minimal effort, and
in reality that's probably all I'll have time for, for another 4 years!

In the 4 years since I last blogged I:

- Met a lovely person
- Got engaged
- Got married!
- Had a baby!!! Who will be two in December

So I have reason to feel I've been busy, and will stay busy.

I still work for ThoughtWorks, though for the UK tentacle.  Doing all sorts
of cool things - which I should blog about, some time.
