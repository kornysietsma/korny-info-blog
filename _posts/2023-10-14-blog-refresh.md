I quit my job! Yes, after 12 amazing years at Thoughtworks, I decided it was time to move on.  

I'm starting a new job in November - more on that later - but in the meantime I was a bit embarassed at they styling here - I'd had fun hacking something together using [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) but it was never quite right, with issues here and there with styling and layouts... and it used the venerable Ruby middleman blogging engine, which I'm sure is fine - but Jekyll seems to have taken over as a common default.

So I'm rebuilding everything in Jekyll - it'll be fairly vanilla using [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) for now, but over time I will fiddle with the defaults.  But in the spirit of incremental iterative working, I'll try to do just enough to get it out with nothing broken, then improve over time.
