## Korny's blog

This is the repo for https://blog.korny.info

It's a middleman blog, fairly ancient layout, probably needs refreshing but
it'll do for now.

## howto

This is more notes to my future self:

`middleman article TITLE` generates a new article
`middleman serve` serves up locally
`middleman build` builds static html etc
then `git add, commit and push` to update https://blog.korny.info

That's about it.

## TODO

* Maybe move this to Jekyll? I'd like to keep links working...
* Explore how the styling works for diagrams and screenshots
