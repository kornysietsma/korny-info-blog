title: Interesting folks to follow on Mastodon

## My highly-idiosyncratic list of interesting people on Mastodon

I've been really enjoying moving from the crumbling mess of Twitter, to the chaotic federated world of Mastodon.  Plenty of other people have talked about the reasons, I'm not going over them all here.

However, one complaint I've heard is "I can't find anyone to follow" which I find quite surprising, as I've found too many people to follow!  So I thought I'd post a short[^1], opinionated list, to help lure people in.

This is mostly tech folks - as that's my interest area, and Mastodon is mostly attracting tech folks and activists right now.  But there are quite a few random non-tech folks too - sorry, it's a bit of an idiosyncratic list!

[^1]: It's not _that_ short, I've just dumped a couple of my lists and cleaned up the names - making a really short list would be more work!

## Aside - how to follow people

I thought I'd call this out separately, as it's sometimes a bit fiddly, especially for new users.

This assumes you are using a browser.  Mobile users can't easily cut and paste URLs, so following someone not on your instance depends a bit on the app you use.

For a user `@fergee@one.mega.cities` their instance is `one.mega.cities` and that is where most of their information lives.  You can browse their details with the url `https://one.mega.cities/@fergee` - and there is a `Follow` button there, but it's not so easy to use if you are not also a `one.mega.cities` user.  (the behaviour seems to differ by instance - or maybe it's mobile vs browser? Some say 'paste this url into search' and some let you re-log in to your home instance)

The easy way to manage this is to find the user's page on _your_ instance.  This is usually a URL like `https://my.instance.name/@fergee@one.mega.cities` though some have slightly different paths.  You can manually make this URL in a browser address bar by just concatenating the `https://my.instance.name/` part with a mastodon handle (starting with a `@`).  Or you can build them using a tool like a spreadsheet, if you want.

Or, you can just paste the user's handle `@fergee@one.mega.cities` into the search box on your main mastodon page, and search 'accounts', and you should end at the same user page _on your own instance_.

Once you get to the person's page on your instance, you can just click 'follow' and a follow request is sent.  Some people auto-accept follows, some manually check you aren't a bot or a nasty person or whatever first.

Once you are following them, you can also add and remove people from custom user lists from the same page.  But that's a different subject.

## My list

Some of these people are quite active, some are just lurking for now.  Some of these people are also dual posting to Twitter, which seems fair enough if you have a big follower count.

I've sorted by number of updates, which will be biased towards really verbose people and those who've been on Mastodon a long time.  But it's easier than other categorisations - what makes someone 'interesting'?? (The count includes posts and 'boosts' which are like re-tweets, so chronic over-sharers will have inflated update values)

I note that there are 5 signatories of the Agile Manifesto in this list!
