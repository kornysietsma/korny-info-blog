<div class='main' role='main'><p>For several years I have been building code visualisation tools, in bits and pieces of my spare time. It started in 2016 with some hacky code I built in clojure and JavaScript/D3 based on <a href="https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat">code-maat</a> - and it's grown in bits and pieces since then - including a complete rewrite using rust for the scanning logic, and React + D3 for the UI. (There's a more detailed history at <a href="https://polyglot.korny.info/history/">https://polyglot.korny.info/history/</a> but it got a bit long for this blog)</p>

<p>The latest iteration is quite different, and mature enough that I thought I should share it more widely, and see if it is useful for other people.</p>

<p>Note I'm going to focus here on <em>what</em> these tools do - if you want to know more about <em>how?</em> and <em>why?</em> I'm going to cover those in more detail on the docs website - though currently it's a bit of a work in progress: <a href="https://polyglot.korny.info">https://polyglot.korny.info</a></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I also talked about this recently on <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/podcasts/code-visualization">the ThoughtWorks Technology podcast</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-polyglot-code-explorer">What is the Polyglot Code Explorer?</h2>

<p>The explorer is the front end component&lt;&gt; of three tightly coupled applications:</p>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/flowchart.png" alt="Tools flowchart" /></p>

<p>The Polyglot Code Scanner scans your source code and produces a JSON data file, then the Polyglot Code Offline Layout tool adds layout information to the data file, and finally the Polyglot Code Explorer is the UI that lets you explore the code.</p>

<p>If you want a quick look at the explorer, I have a <a href="http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/">simple demo using qgis</a> or <a href="http://polyglot-code-explorer-openmrs.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/">a more complex one based on OpenMRS</a> hosed on AWS S3.</p>

<p>The source code is on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-it-for">What is it for?</h2>

<p>Fundamentally, I wanted to answer the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can we visualise large codebases without needing complex language-specific parsers and logic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Partly I wanted to easily spot toxic code - my colleague <a href="https://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/">Erik Dörnenberg wrote some great articles on Toxic code visualisation</a> and I wanted a way to spot some of these problem areas myself.</p>

<p>But also, I just wanted to be able to explore the code quickly.  I'm a visual thinker, so my main focus is on visualisation - especially when trying to spot patterns in millions of lines of code.</p>

<p>It is far quicker for me to look at a diagram and see some unusual colouring in one area, than to see the same information in a table of numbers.</p>

<h2 id="why-polyglot">Why polyglot?</h2>

<p>Polyglot means "speaking multiple languages" - in this case, it means these tools should work, to some degree, on any text-based programming language.</p>

<p>I've worked in many programming languages over the years, and a lot of them don't have good or easy code quality tools - either they are too new for a community to have built them, or they are from ancient projects where even if such tools exist, getting them up and running is a real hassle.</p>

<p>Also many systems don't use a single language - we have a number of great programming languages with special "sweet spots" and it's quite common to have UIs built in a quite different language to the services or the systems tools.  Comparing them with language-specific tools is almost impossible - and there's a big risk of comparing apples with oranges and getting data that isn't very helpful.</p>

<p>Also I was inspired by reading Adam Tornhill's book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23627482-your-code-as-a-crime-scene">"Your code as a crime scene"</a> - he talks about all the things you can learn just from really simple metrics like lines of code, and indentation, and change history.  None of these need a complex language parser - and complex language parsers tend to be touchy and flaky.  Most of this code uses no language parser at all, or just a simple one to remove blank lines and comments.  This is great when you want to look at a brand new language, or an ancient language, where no reliable parser may exist.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-ui">Using the UI</h2>

<p>The Explorer front end looks somewhat like this:</p>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/Main_UI.png" alt="Main UI" /></p>

<p>There is more about how to use the UI <a href="http://localhost:2222/tools/explorer/ui">on the docs site</a></p>

<p>The centre of the display shows the files in your project - I'm using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_Voronoi_diagram">Weighted Voronoi Diagram</a> which has the big advantage of showing files roughly in proportional to their size.  And by size I'm using lines of code, which is generally much more useful than bytes - especially as research tends to show that high lines of code is correlated with complexity and defects - so just looking for large lines of code is a good starting point for finding problems.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-by-programming-language">Viewing by programming language</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_language.png" alt="language visualisation" /></p>

<p>This is very simple - it just colours each file by programming language, showing the 10 most common languages.  Mostly useful for getting an overview of what goes where - it's usually easy to spot the front-end vs back-end code by the colours used.  (only 10 languages are shown because beyond that, it's hard to visually see different colours)</p>

<h3 id="lines-of-code">Lines of code</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_loc.png" alt="lines of code" /></p>

<p>This is simple enough - it's a scale from blue for tiny files, through to yellow for giant files.</p>

<p>Note that this is not a linear scale - a lot of these use what I call a "Good/Bad/Ugly" scale - blue (0) is good, red (1000) is bad, and yellow (10000 and above) is just ugly.  If I used a linear scale, it'd be harder to distinguish the good/bad files from each other.  (yes, I could use a log scale, but that has it's own problems)</p>

<h3 id="nesting-depth">Nesting depth</h3>

<p>This isn't usually very useful - it just shows how deeply nested files are.  Might sometimes be useful if you want to see what is where in the UI.</p>

<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_indentation.png" alt="indentation" /></p>

<p>This is an interesting one. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC.2008.13">Hindle, Abram, Michael W. Godfrey, and Richard C. Holt. 2008. ‘Reading Beside the Lines: Indentation as a Proxy for Complexity Metric’</a> they found that indentation is often useful as a way of looking for complexity - and it makes sense; files with a lot of indentation are often files with deeply nested "if" and "case" statements.  You can choose a few sub-visualisations here - the default shows the standard deviation of indentation, which is often the most useful metric; you can also see the worst indentation in each file, and the "total area" which is useful for also showing very large deeply indented files.</p>

<p>Of course this can have false positives - heavy indentation might just be a strange formatting style, or for other valid reasons.  But this is often surprisingly useful.</p>

<h3 id="age-since-last-change">Age since last change</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_age.png" alt="age since last change" /></p>

<p>This shows how long it is since each file was changed (from git history) blue files are recently changed, yellow files haven't changed for 1460 days in this example (4 years).  Note that this is affected by the date selector down the bottom of the page:</p>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/date_selector.png" alt="date selector" /></p>

<p>Files that haven't changed in the selected date range will show in grey.  You need to select the whole project (drag the left side of the selector to the left of the screen) to see change information across the whole scanned date range.</p>

<p>This is a good/bad/ugly scale again, largely because generally files that haven't changed for a long time are, in my experience, parts of the system that nobody understands or feels safe to touch.</p>

<p>However this is a bit contentious - it depends a lot on the culture of the organisation, and the kind of code - a lot of research in this field shows the flip-side of this, that files that haven't changed for ages are stable. If they had bugs, people would have touched them - so these files might be "safe".  Personally, coming from an agile world where shared code ownership is important, and rapid change is the norm, I see old untouched files as something that might show stagnation and maintenance nightmares - I think a lot of what is "good" here depends on what you are looking for.</p>

<h3 id="creation-date">Creation date</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_creation.png" alt="creation date" /></p>

<p>This <em>doesn't</em> use a good/bad scale - it's not really about quality, but sometimes it's useful to know which files are new, and which are old.  This is especially handy when you are using the date selector, to give you a feel for how the code has changed over time.</p>

<p>However, there is a problem here that requires a bit of a digression</p>

<h4 id="the-problem-with-the-date-selector">The problem with the date selector</h4>

<p>The scanner starts with the files currently on your filesystem - and then it works backwards in time through the git logs.  It doesn't really keep track of the actual state of your system over time, or file renames, or deleted files.  If you create a file <code>foo.c</code>, and do a pile of work on it, and then delete it, the scanner will not show it - there's not really anywhere in the JSON data file to store that data!  Similarly renames are not handled well - it sees a file rename, but isn't great at tracking what happens to the file before the rename.  (This is something I plan to fix, when I can!  But it's non-trivial - you can't just track file renames by time, you need to track them by branch…)</p>

<p>So moving the date selector is handy for limiting some kinds of information, and getting some views of the past - but it's not actually a window into the past state of the project.</p>

<h3 id="unique-changers">Unique changers</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_unique_changers.png" alt="unique changers" /></p>

<p>This shows how many different people touched a file, in the selected date range. Again is a bit of an "it depends" metric - some studies show that few changers are good, as they tend to be just experts and not new inexperienced people.  But again, too few changers can be a sign that only one person knows a piece of code, so you don't have any collective code ownership, and if that one person leaves, you might have some unknown code.  (There's some really interesting research in this area, which I'd love to look into in the future - such as looking at how new/old each changer is to the organisation, how long they've been touching this area of the code, and the like).</p>

<p>This has a custom colour scheme because it's not as simple as good/bad.  Basically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No changers is bad, so it's highlighted in cyan.  This probably means that no-one currently understands the code at all.</li>
  <li>One changer might be OK, though I'd see it as an ownership risk.  This is shown in dark red.</li>
  <li>Two to Eight coders is, in my view, generally OK.  This is a "two-pizza team" - it's fine for the whole team to be changing a file.</li>
  <li>Eight to 30 coders is definitely risky - maybe the file is tightly coupled with several areas of code, or full of bugs so people keep needing to fix it. High numbers are in brighter colours.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note</em> there is one current limitation here - the system treats unique user names / emails as unique individuals.  So if you change email or git account, you will look like two people.  I plan to add some way to flag duplicate names - possibly using <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-check-mailmap">the pretty obscure git .mailmap file format</a>.  But this might be a fair way down my to-do list.</p>

<h3 id="churn">Churn</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_churn.png" alt="churn" /></p>

<p>Churn shows the rate of change - how often a file has changed in the selected date window.  This again isn't necessarily good or bad - it depends a lot on what date range you are using.  If a file changes every work day over several years, that's probably bad!  But if it changes every day over the course of a short project, that might be fine.</p>

<p>There are three sub-visualisations here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Days containing a change - this is in proportion to the number of days selected.  So "0.5" means the file has changed every second day, on average.  This doesn't care how often in the day a file changed, so 10 commits on one day looks the same as 1 commit.</li>
  <li>Commits per day - this is the sum of commits, divided by the number of days.  So "0.5" means on average one commit every two days - but this might mean 150 commits on one day, and none the rest of the year.</li>
  <li>Lines per day - this is the sum of the number of lines changed (both adds and deletes) divided by the number of days.  So tiny tweaks to files won't show up nearly as brightly as large numbers of lines added or deleted.  Good for seeing where more work is being done.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="temporal-coupling">Temporal Coupling</h3>

<p><img src="/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/Coupling.png" alt="coupling" /></p>

<p>This is based on ideas from Adam Tornhill's books, plus some research - it tries to work out when files might be tightly coupled to each other, based on when the files change in git.  Adam calls this "Temporal Coupling".</p>

<p>The curved lines show which files seem to be temporally coupled to which other files.</p>

<p>Note each line is unidirectional - file A may be coupled to file B, but file B may not be coupled to file A.</p>

<p>For example, in the screenshot above, the file <code>testprocessinggui.cpp</code> had commits on 22 days in the date range selected.</p>

<p>The file <code>qgisapp.cpp</code> was also changed on 20 of the same days.</p>

<p>According to the current coupling algorithm, this means it has a ratio of 0.909 - 90% of commits to <code>testprocessinggui.cpp</code> seem to have also implied commits to <code>qgisapp.cpp</code>.</p>

<p>The converse might not be true -  <code>qgisapp.cpp</code> might have changed on another 20 unrelated days, so it might not have a coupling connection back to <code>testprocessinggui.cpp</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously this logic can produce a lot of false positives, if files change a lot coincidentally.</p>

<p>At the moment, this either produces far too many links, or far too few.  I think this needs a lot of work - at minimum, it should use a much smaller time window than a day!  I am probably going to try to make it changes within an hour, and see if that helps.</p>

<p>Most of the research in this area tracks changes within a single commit - but this doesn't work so well for projects with lots of repositories, such as microservices projects.  A huge benefit of this sort of coupling display, if it works, is to find those hidden dependencies between projects - knowing that every time you change the Foo service, you also need to change a file in the Bar service, could be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-run-this-myself">How can I run this myself?</h2>

<p>There are some <a href="https://polyglot.korny.info/tools/explorer/howto">How-to guides on the docs site</a></p>

<p>A very brief summary:</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-executable-files">Getting the executable files</h3>

<p>Each of the tools is packaged up as an executable file - the Scanner is written in rust, so it's easy to just compile a binary.  The Layout app is a node.js script, I've used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg">pkg</a> to build a bundled executable.  And the Explorer can be run as a static website, so the packages are all the files needed to build the website, which you can run yourself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scanner executables can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/releases">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/releases</a></li>
  <li>Layout executables can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout/releases">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout/releases</a></li>
  <li>Explorer bundles can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer/releases">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer/releases</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are on a Mac you will need to strip Apple's quarantine attributes from the binary files to avoid the "app is from an unknown developer" error:</p>

<p>```sh
tar zxf polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
cd polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine polyglot_code_scanner</p>

<p>unzip polyglot-code-offline-layout-macos.zip
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine polyglot-code-offline-layout
```</p>

<p>The Explorer is not an executable file - it's a zip file containing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files needed to run the site.  You can run them locally by running a tiny web server yourself - for example with Python 2 you can run <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>, or with Python 3: <code>python3 -m http.server</code></p>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>A short sample of running these together might help:</p>

<p>```sh
$ cd ~/work
$ polyglot_code_scanner –coupling –years 3 -o my_project_1.json ~/src/my_project
# this can be slow for big projects, or if you scan back through many years of history
# coupling is optional, remove –coupling to speed it up if you don't want it
# Check there are no errors and the my_project_1.json file is there</p>

<p>$ polyglot-code-offline-layout -i my_project_1.json -o my_project_2.json
# this can be slow for big files
# Check there are no errors and the my_project_2.json file is there</p>

<h1 id="the-first-time-you-need-to-unzip-the-explorer-files">the first time, you need to unzip the explorer files</h1>
<p>$ unzip ~/downloads/polyglot-code-explorer.zip 
Archive:  polyglot-code-explorer.zip
   creating: polyglot-code-explorer/
$ cp my_project_2.json polyglot-code-explorer/data/default.json
$ cd polyglot-code-explorer
$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)
```</p>

<p>Then open a browser to <a href="http://0.0.0.0:8000">http://0.0.0.0:8000</a> to start exploring!</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>I'm keen to keep tinkering with this - I have a pile of possible enhancements, and a long list of research to read!  And a 3 year old and almost no spare time :)</p>

<p>I'd love to get feedback - feel free to add comments on the Discus form below, or contact me (contact details are at <a href="https://korny.info">https://korny.info</a>) - or for bugs / improvements you can raise issues on the linked github projects.</p>
